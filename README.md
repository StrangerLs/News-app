## Project Description


This app will pull information from News API and return and appenend titles, images, and links, from multiple news sources around the world based on users input via a list. ie... if you type in donald trump it will pull up top news articles about him from around the world. The app will then append the news articles to the dom and enable you to open them within the same page.

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- use news API to get info on whatever news topic the user searches
- clickable link, image and title of news articles to send user to source. 
- html and css layout similar to mockup with responsive design.


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add filter functionality to filter by news source, language
- Css animations for articles

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|Feb 23| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Feb 23| Html setup/axios set up | Incomplete
|Feb 24| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Feb 24| finish functionality (Javasctipt) | Incomplete
|Feb 25| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e7d73d31-4174-4f8c-8d5b-462167700223/edit?page=0_0#

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
